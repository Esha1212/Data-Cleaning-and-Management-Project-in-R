# Data-Cleaning-and-Management-Project-in-R
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and managing a dataset using R, a powerful programming language for statistical computing and data analysis. The project covers various techniques to ensure the data is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis.
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline. This project involves cleaning and managing a real-world dataset, addressing common issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, duplicates, and incorrect data types. The goal is to transform raw data into a well-structured, clean dataset that can be used for further analysis or modeling.

**Features**

**Handling Missing Data:** Identifying and appropriately handling missing values using techniques such as imputation, removal, or substitution with default values.

**Data Type Conversion:** Converting data types to ensure consistency and accuracy, such as transforming strings to factors or dates to appropriate date-time formats.

**Removing Duplicates:** Detecting and removing duplicate entries to avoid data redundancy and ensure accurate analysis.

**Outlier Detection and Treatment:** Identifying and addressing outliers that could skew analysis results, using methods such as capping, removal, or transformation.

**Data Standardization:** Standardizing data formats (e.g., converting all text to lowercase, standardizing date formats) to maintain uniformity across the dataset.

**Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or modifying existing ones to enhance the dataset's utility for analysis or modeling.

**Data Validation:** Checking for consistency and validity of data (e.g., ensuring all dates fall within a specific range, all categorical values are within expected categories).

**Tools and Libraries**

**R:** The primary language used for data cleaning and management.

**tidyverse:** A collection of R packages (including dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2) used for data manipulation, tidying, and visualization.

**lubridate:** Used for date-time manipulation.

**stringr:** Used for string manipulation.

**janitor:** A package that provides simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty data.

**How to Use**

**Download the Project Files:** Clone or download the project files from the repository.

**Install Required Libraries:** Ensure you have all necessary R packages installed by running the provided install_packages.R script.

**Load the Dataset:** Load the dataset using the provided R scripts.

**Run the Data Cleaning Script:** Execute the data cleaning script to transform the raw data into a clean, structured format.

**Review the Output:** Review the cleaned dataset and summary statistics to verify the quality and integrity of the data.

**Example Datasets**

The project includes example datasets to illustrate the data cleaning process. These datasets come from various domains (e.g., finance, healthcare, retail) to demonstrate the versatility of the techniques applied.
